# BUGS

Bugs noticed during sessions but not fixed in the current scope.

Reviewed every PR. Use `/quirk:artifacts:bug` to append. Do not edit older
entries' IDs; manual edits to fix typos are fine.

## BUG-1: Artifact lock files are not gitignored
- **Observed**: 2026-08-06
- **File**: .gitignore:6
- **Description**: artifact_append.py creates .<ARTIFACT>.lock beside each artifact file (bin/artifact_append.py:165), but .gitignore's '.lock' entry matches only a file literally named .lock, not .BUGS.md.lock. Verified: git check-ignore -v .BUGS.md.lock exits 1. artifact_init.py adds no ignore entry either, so every project adopting typed-artifacts accumulates untracked lock files in its root.
- **Introduced by**: pre-dates this session
- **Severity**: low
- **Proposed fix**: Add a '.*.lock' pattern to the templates and have artifact_init.py append it to the target project's .gitignore.
- **Resolved**: 2026-08-07. Fixed differently than proposed: locks moved to .quirk/locks/ which carries its own .gitignore of '*', so no project's root .gitignore is edited and projects that adopted artifacts earlier self-heal on their next append. artifact_init.py also removes legacy root locks. Phase 1 has no Status field, so --index still counts this entry open; see DEFER-1.

## BUG-2: artifact_append.py writes non-atomically while pm.py writes atomically
- **Observed**: 2026-08-06
- **File**: bin/artifact_append.py:175
- **Description**: The append path uses a plain target.write_text(new_text), so a crash mid-write truncates the ledger. bin/pm.py's writers use an atomic temp-file-plus-os.replace helper. Both mutate the same files, so one ledger now has two different crash-safety properties depending on which script touched it last.
- **Introduced by**: pre-dates this session; the asymmetry is new as of the pm.py work
- **Severity**: medium
- **Proposed fix**: Backport the atomic write helper to artifact_append.py.
- **Blocker for**: any claim that the ledger survives a crash mid-append

## BUG-3: Skill(quirk:adversarial-review) returns the command wrapper instead of loading its protocol
- **Observed**: 2026-08-06
- **File**: skills/adversarial-review/SKILL.md
- **Description**: Invoking the skill from a fresh session returns the routing text of commands/adversarial-review.md ('This command only routes to it - do not restate its rules here') rather than SKILL.md's protocol. A second invocation reports the instructions as 'previously loaded' while they are absent from context. subagent-driven-development Step 8 delegates its entire review gate to this skill, so the documented delegation seam does not work as written; the mechanical layer at scripts/adversarial-review had to be driven directly for all five review rounds of this branch.
- **Introduced by**: pre-dates this session
- **Severity**: high
- **Proposed fix**: Reproduce a Skill invocation from a clean session and fix whichever of the command file or the skill resolution is shadowing SKILL.md.
- **Blocker for**: subagent-driven-development's review gate being usable as documented

## BUG-4: artifact_append.py reads and writes with the platform-default encoding
- **Observed**: 2026-08-06
- **File**: bin/artifact_append.py:169
- **Description**: read_text()/write_text() are called with no encoding, so the ledger's on-disk encoding follows each host's locale. A file written on a latin-1 host is not readable as the same text on a utf-8 host. bin/pm.py had to couple its own decode order to this behaviour (platform codec first when that codec is not utf-8) to avoid silently misreading files quirk itself wrote. That coupling is a workaround; this is the root cause.
- **Introduced by**: pre-dates this session
- **Severity**: medium
- **Proposed fix**: Pin encoding='utf-8' on both calls, with a one-time migration for any ledger written under a non-utf-8 locale.
