# Pi Code Quality Reviewer Dispatch Template

Use this when the runtime is **pi** (see SKILL.md → Runtime Selection).

The code-quality reviewer model is the **pi-dev `gemini` alias** (see **quirk:pi-dev**) — not a
frozen model id. `pi-watch` resolves the newest authed model in the alias's fallback ladder;
hard-pinning an exact id via `--provider`/`--model` is the documented exception, not the default.

The task captain (or the orchestrator acting as fallback dispatcher when no captain can be
dispatched) dispatches this concurrently with the spec-compliance and Codex adversarial
reviewers, after the implementer reports.

## Prompt body

The Claude path uses the `quirk:code-reviewer` agent template (see
`code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md`). The pi path needs the same review prompt
inlined, because pi has no awareness of Claude Code agent definitions.

Build the prompt body from the template at
`requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md` — substitute the placeholders the
same way the Claude `Task` invocation would:

- `WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED`: from the implementer's report
- `PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS` / `PLAN_REFERENCE`: paste Task N's full text inline (Contract,
  Acceptance, everything) — plans are in-context by default; subagents never read a plan file.
  The underlying template uses both names for the same slot; fill both with the same pasted text.
- `BASE_SHA`: commit before this task
- `HEAD_SHA`: current commit
- `DESCRIPTION`: short task summary

Append the same additional checks the Claude path requires:
- Does each file have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface?
- Are units decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently?
- Is the implementation following the file structure from the plan?
- Did this implementation create new files that are already large, or
  significantly grow existing files? (Don't flag pre-existing file sizes —
  focus on what this change contributed.)

## Suggested patch

The assembled prompt must also require a proposed unified diff capped at roughly 20 changed
lines for each LOW/MEDIUM or mechanical/objective HIGH finding. It must forbid patches for
CRITICAL or judgment-requiring findings and require every patch path to stay within the task's
`scope.files` and outside `scope.never_touch`. The reviewer remains report-only: it includes
eligible patch text in its finding, but never applies it, runs `git apply`, or edits files.

End the prompt with: "Return Strengths, Issues grouped Critical/Important/Minor,
and an Assessment line."

## Invocation

Write the assembled prompt body to a task/role-keyed file **outside the repository**
(see SKILL.md → Dispatch hygiene — never a generic name inside the worktree, where a
worker could commit or clobber it), e.g. `<scratch>/t<N>-quality-review.md`, then:

```bash
cd <worktree>
PROMPT=<scratch>/t<N>-quality-review.md
[ -f "$PROMPT" ] || { echo "prompt missing" >&2; exit 1; }
pi-watch --alias gemini \
  --tools read,bash \
  "$(cat "$PROMPT")"
```

`pi-watch` has no `@file` include — the prompt is passed as a positional string, so the file's
contents are inlined via `$(cat ...)`. It resolves the newest authed model in the `gemini` alias's
fallback ladder automatically; hard-pinning an exact model id via `--provider`/`--model` is the
documented exception (**quirk:pi-dev**), not the default.

Verify the prompt file exists before dispatching — never fall back to
something like `cat quality-review-prompt.md || echo MISSING` that pipes
garbage into a live worker; a bad prompt burns the entire dispatch.

`--tools read,bash` grants shell access, not enforced read-only — `bash` can mutate the
filesystem; the prompt body forbids modifications behaviorally, not via the tool grant. This
reviewer doesn't need to run builds, tests, or git, so prefer `--tools read,grep,find,ls`
(actually read-only) unless a specific check needs shell.

For the hardened multi-arg recipe, see **quirk:pi-dev →
reference/print-mode.md#canonical-headless-recipe**.

## Output parsing

The reviewer's final message contains `Strengths`, `Issues` grouped by
severity, an `Assessment`, and `Suggested patch` content for eligible findings. Parse pi's stdout
for that structure. Findings are returned to the task captain for fan-in and adjudication
alongside the other reviewers applicable to the task's risk tier (or to the orchestrator when it
is acting as fallback dispatcher). The captain may apply an accepted eligible patch directly only
after enforcing the roughly-20-changed-line cap, running `git apply --check`, and confirming all
paths are within `scope.files` and outside `scope.never_touch`; CRITICAL and judgment-requiring
findings route to the fix worker. The reviewer only proposes patches and never applies them.
There is no per-reviewer fix loop (SKILL.md → Per-task review chain).

If pi's response is unparseable, apply **quirk:pi-dev → Reviewer JSON parse
fallback** (cascade: whole-message JSON → fenced block → balanced braces →
synthesize a NEEDS_FIX verdict). Never count an unparseable response as PASS.

## Failure detection

Apply **quirk:pi-dev → Failure detection** rules. On auth/billing failure,
fall back to Claude agents for the rest of the plan (SKILL.md → Fallback).
